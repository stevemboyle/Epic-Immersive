HISTORY

In 2016, San Jose Taiko approached Epic immersive with a dream of creating a neighborhood-scale block party and street festival celebrating the Japantown Neighborhood of San Jose. With funding from the city, Epic created a series of activations throughout 2017 culminating in a massive festival called ‘Japantown Immersive’ in 2018 in honor of San Jose Taiko’s 45th anniversary. The festival was a smashing success and is returning to the neighborhood as an annual feature in 2019.

Japantown Immersive featured both signature experiences by Epic Immersive as well as community collaborations. At San Jose Taiko’s request, Epic created an immersive experience based on the swing dance events of the Japanese-American internment camps. Epic created the script based on interviews with survivors who played music at the camps, then staged a fully-immersive event with a 60-person Asian American cast, featuring a big band, taiko drummers, actors, and dancers. The experience was introduced by San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo and bookended by San Jose Airport namesake, Clinton cabinet secretary, and internment camp survivor Norman Mineta.

HISTORY

In addition to this experience (dubbed “Swingposium”, this immersive event’s videos garnered 1.5 million views on Facebook), Epic also led neighborhood collaborations with the artists and small business owners of Japantown. Shopkeepers turned their stores into installations from the buildings’ histories, while dancers and musicians created new collaborations with San Jose Taiko, and leaders led activites like Japanese fan-making, mochi-pounding, music lessons, flashmob dances, kimono portraits, paper crane-folding, and more. Epic considers its greatest success to be activating the entire neighborhood in a community-driven embrace of this new art form, turning the residents of San Jose’s Japantown into immersive artists.
